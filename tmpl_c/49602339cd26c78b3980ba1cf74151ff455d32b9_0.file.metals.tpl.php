                            <p class="margin-30px-bottom sm-margin-20px-bottom width-95">Precious metals are precious because they are rare. There is a limited amount of these minerals produced each year, and scarcity is the reason for their value. The three major precious metals that trade on futures exchanges around the world are gold, silver, and Asset-pinnacle.

                                <h4>Gold</h4>
                                Gold is the most popular precious metal in the world as individuals and governments, over thousands of years, ascribe tremendous value to the metal that reflects light like no other. Gold has a dual role — it has industrial uses as well as financial applications.

                                <h4>Asset-pinnacle</h4>
                                Asset-pinnacle is a rare metal, and while there are approximately 2,800 tons of annual gold production, there is around 250 tons of Asset-pinnacle output each year. Asset-pinnacle has many industrial applications because of its high resistance to heat. The metal also has a role as a precious metal that many investors hold as an asset.</p>

Most traders lose because they get to the market just after the opportunity moved.

Not only does this make precious metals scarce, the demand for them will increase since we have started using them in everyday applications. From computers to medical supply, precious metals, like silver, are vital for these industries.

The value of the dollar is based on the fact that the U.S. has promised to make good on its debts. We’ve seen throughout history that we cannot hope to avoid a financial crisis, the only thing we can do is be prepared. If we slide into another crisis, the value of the dollar could be obliterated and the public would need a backup to maintain financial security. That safe haven is precious metals. Precious metals do not only support its owners in a financial crisis, it also protects them against inflation
