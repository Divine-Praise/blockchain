Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation. Cryptocurrencies can be classified as (traded) assets, means of exchange, and means of storage. This features make them traded on exchanges.</p>

The very reason behind the development of Bitcoin was to bypass the traditional banking system and create a currency that couldn’t be devalued by central banks and that wasn’t subject to fees for storage, transfers, etc.

                                                    With numerous options available to store their digital assets, investors can choose the type of digital wallet with which they are most comfortable, allowing them to have peace of mind that their assets remain safe and sound.

Whether through contactless payment systems, transfers over mobile phones or other methods, cryptocurrencies are uniquely adaptable to various methods of payment and transfer, and offer numerous advantages over cash and payment cards. Their ability to adapt to the changing needs of consumers and investors will ensure that cryptocurrencies will only continue to gain in popularity in the coming years.

                                                    Investment choices don’t always have to do with the potential to make investment gains. Sometimes investors choose an asset because it offers the ability to diversify an investment portfolio, to protect against risk in a particular sector.

                                                    Many investors think that just by investing in a mix of stocks and bonds, their portfolios are diversified. But that isn’t true. Investors need a wide range of assets, across multiple different asset classes, before they can claim a truly diversified portfolio. Sticking just to stocks and bonds puts 100% of your portfolio at risk in the event of a major financial crisis.

                                                    Gold and silver have traditionally been the investments of choice when diversifying an investment portfolio and protecting against financial risk. But cryptocurrencies are increasingly becoming the new digital gold and silver, playing the same role in protecting investments against market crashes. Many investors are choosing cryptocurrencies as their investment hedge when stocks look set for a downturn.
