                            <p class="margin-30px-bottom sm-margin-20px-bottom width-95">Options are financial instruments that are derivatives based on the value of underlying securities such as stocks. An options contract offers the buyer the opportunity to buy or sell—depending on the type of contract they hold—the underlying asset. Unlike futures, the holder is not required to buy or sell the asset if they choose not to.

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong><u>Call options</u></strong> allow the holder to buy the asset at a stated price within a specific timeframe.</li>
                                    <li><strong><u>Put options</u></strong> allow the holder to sell the asset at a stated price within a specific timeframe.</li>
                                </ul>
                                Each option contract will have a specific expiration date by which the holder must exercise their option. The stated price on an option is known as the strike price. Options are typically bought and sold through investment companies, online or retail brokers.</p>

                                                    These are basic trading strategies for trading Options. Tjhere are even more advanced ways.

                                                    For example, using the scenario from above, we'll compare the percentage returns of the stock (purchased for $50) and the option (purchased at $6). Let's say the option has a delta of 80, meaning the option's price will change 80% of the stock's price change. If the stock were to go up to $5, your stock position would provide a 10% return. Your option position would gain 80% of the stock movement (due to its 80 delta), or $4. A $4 gain on a $6 investment amounts to a 67% return—much better than the 10% return on the stock. Of course, when the trade doesn't go your way, options can exact a heavy toll: there is the possibility you will lose 100% of your investment.

                                                    There are situations in which buying options are riskier than owning equities, but there are also times when options can be used to reduce risk. It really depends on how you use them. Options can be less risky for investors because they require less financial commitment than equities, and they can also be less risky due to their relative imperviousness to the potentially catastrophic effects of gap openings.

                                                    Options are the most dependable form of hedge, and this also makes them safer than stocks. When an investor purchases stocks, a stop-loss order is frequently placed to protect the position. The stop order is designed to stop losses below a predetermined price identified by the investor. The problem with these orders lies in the nature of the order itself. A stop order is executed when the stock trades at or below the limit as indicated in the order.

                                                    The final major advantage of options is they offer more investment alternatives. Options are a very flexible tool. There are many ways to use options to recreate other positions. We call these positions synthetics.

                                                    Synthetic positions present investors with multiple ways to attain the same investment goals, which can be very useful. While synthetic positions are considered an advanced option topic, options offer many other strategic alternatives. For example, many investors use brokers who charge a margin when an investor wants to short a stock. The cost of this margin requirement can be quite prohibitive. Other investors use brokers who simply do not allow for the shorting of stocks, period. The inability to play the downside when needed virtually handcuffs investors and forces them into a black-and-white world while the market trades in color. But no broker has any rule against investors purchasing puts to play the downside, and this is a definite benefit of options trading.
