                                             The foreign exchange market is one of most liquid financial markets in the world. The liquidity of a financial market is determined by the number of buyers and sellers. It means forex market has large number of buyers and sellers that are matched within a fraction of second. This enables traders to have greater opportunities to win a trade by getting a fair price to buy and sell their currency pairs. That is why forex market is extremely liquid. High liquidity means low risk of price manipulation by a few big players. High liquidity and large size of the market, itâ€™s almost impossible to manipulate prices.
